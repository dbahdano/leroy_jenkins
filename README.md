Leroy is a freeware software deployment engine that can be integrated into any build system. 
More information and documentation about Leroy is available at http://www.leroydeploy.com. 
The purpose of the Leroy-Jenkins plugin is to help integrate Leroy's deployment functionality
and configuration management with Jenkin's presentation and access control abilities. This 
allows one to create a web based application deployment dashboard granting software, system 
and devops engineers to work together to bring automation and consistency to deployments using 
a simple xml format stored in SCM.
