You can choose to either take Leroy deployment configurations as the last change in your SCM, or fetch configurations from the last successfull deployment.
For build/dev environments SCM is a good choice so that you can test changes in your deployment.
Environments such as test, uat, stage and prod may want to choose "Last Success" so that we are assured we're using a stable revision of the deployment.
